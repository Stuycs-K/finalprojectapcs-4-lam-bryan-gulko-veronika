# Project Description

lorem ipsum.

# Intended usage:

## Fruits slicer
In processing, different objects (which will be the fruit) will be falling onto the screen and the player will use the mouse to slice through the fruit. (When the mouse touches the fruit, the pixels it touches can change color.) The fruit will be cut into pieces and points will be added to the player, with the number depending on the fruit or the speed that the fruit is falling in.

## Spot the difference (kernel editor)
A png image is provided or made by processing, and two copies will be displayed. One of the copies would have a kernel applied to parts of the image (enough for the differences to be seen, but should mostly be the same picture). The player can click on different parts of the image and if the color of the pixel is different from the original, a point is added until all differences are found.

## Color Match
We will display a  couple common objects (apple, car, etc.) and have the player mix colors to create a shade that matches the object. The game will then match the colors side by side and rate the accuracy of the player by calculating and comparing the rgb values.
