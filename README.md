# Project Description

lorem ipsum.

# Intended usage:

To start the game, press the start button using the mouse. If you want to change the frequency (of the time), press 'A' to increase so less fruit appears or press 'N' so more fruit appear at a time. The frequency can become negative, but the game only starts if frequency is above 0. When the game starts, press down on the mouse and start swiping over the fruits. The mouse has to be pressed down on the fruit  in order to cut and some fruits (dragon fruit, watermelon, and coconut) requires at least 2 swipes, and each fruit will add 5 points. Touching a piece of trash or letting a fruit fall without cutting takes away one life. Touching a bomb is an automatic game over. If you lose all lives, press the restart icon on the right hand corner and it resets everything.
