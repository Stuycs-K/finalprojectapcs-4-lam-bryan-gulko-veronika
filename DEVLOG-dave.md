I wrote the Fruit Class. I created the fields from the UML and added more in order to keep track of the state and position of the fruit. The constructor initializes the arrays, makes the fruit uncut, and randomly picks a fruit by using Math.random on the arrays indexes. The gravity method right now simply adds the speed to the y-coordinate of the fruit, the points method, which will be called in mouseclicked checks if it touches the image, and visualizer displays it. Took about 1.5 hours to complete.
